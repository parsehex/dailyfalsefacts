## Q & A

**Why did you make this?**

Great question. A few reasons:

- It's something to pass the time and I think it's funny.
- I'm wanting to put renewed effort into things that I've made in the past, Daily False Facts being one of them.
- As an added bnous, it's surprisingly stimulating to just think to yourself, "what's something that's not true?".

**Are you the original creator of this site?**

Yeah.

**What is a False Fact?**

A sentence that is not true.

**How can I spot a False Fact?**

First, try saying the sentence out loud and then ask yourself, "*does that sound like bullshit*?"
If you answer Yes, then it's probably not true -- you should investigate further to be sure.

**Is this / Are you serious?**

No, this is a joke site. You've gotta believe me.

More questions (collapsible)

- Is this AI?
  Aside from parts of the code, no. I haven't used AI / LLMs to generate any of the written content on the site. When I make an expansion to Daily False Facts with AI, it will be clearly marked, and hopefully unique or at least funny.

## History of Daily False Facts

For now, I'm going based off my memory here.

- I created a blog on Blogger / Blogspot called **Completely False Facts and Statistics**, where I posted *False Facts* and *False Statistics* posts every (alternating) day.
- After realizing that **Daily False Facts** was a better name, I bought the domain name and stuck a WordPress site on it using a shared hosting provider.
- After submitting the site to [PointlessSites.com](https://www.pointlesssites.com/), it gained traffic and was able to grow into a nice little community of fellow enthusiasts of false information.
- (Plenty of details that I don't completely remember. ***`TO-DO`***)
- Eventually, DailyFalseFacts.com had became unbearably slow and was beyond what I could improve or fix, leading to the site's closure.

## What am I planning?

I have an idea or two, but not anything to warrant the ominous wording of this question. My goal is to keep Daily False Facts light-weight.

### The Daily False Facts Fakenewletter (weekly)

I thought a Fakenewsletter sounded pretty funny. It's just a weekly round-up of the posts in a week. It being weekly instead of daily is also part of the joke and I'd appreciate laughter about it.

### AI

I feel like this one's pretty obvious, but I want to be thoughtful about whatever I use it for.

- AI World of False Facts: A sub-site that's made up entirely of _AI generated_ false facts based on your input. At last, you'l be able to get on-demand false information whenever you want it.
- AI Videos: It sounds like it could be funny to make a AI-generated video based on a false fact, or maybe a group of them.

In general, I like and appreciate what AI makes possible when combined with some additional effort. AI by itself and on its own is boring to me.
