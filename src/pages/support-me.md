### You're awesome for visiting this page

So - - you're thinking about donating to me? Or maybe you're just sleuthing around, which is cool too. Let me talk a little bit and then I'll get you some links.

## Who am I?

I'm Thomas and I've been doing things with code for a while, about 15 years off-and-on. For the majority of that time, I gave up on being social and recently have been trying to undo that as well as I can.

Approaching the age of 31, I haven't lived on my own before and still live with my family, which is another thing that I'm trying to correct for in my own way.

My hope is to establish myself independently so that I can feel like I have my own identity and voice again, which is something that I need to maintain or else I go crazy.

## My other work

Still not convinced or just don't care? I hear that.

Here are some other projects of mine:

- **Have an account on GitHub and want an automatic portfolio?**
  - [PD Gallery](https://github.com/ProjectDepot/Gallery) gives you a clean, stylish and zero-maintenance website that lists your projects. Example: [My portfolio](https://parsehex.github.io/).
- **Do you want to use your gaming PC to chat with people that don't exist?**
  - [buddyGenAI](https://github.com/parsehex/buddyGenAI) might be up your alley.
- If you like old and unfinished web games, maybe you'd like [Incremental Forest](https://github.com/parsehex/incremental-forest).
- You should already know about [Daily False Facts](https://dailyfalsefacts.com/) but it's worth a mention for those unaware.
